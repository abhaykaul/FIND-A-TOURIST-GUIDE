# FIND-A-TOURIST-GUIDE
This is a web Interface where users can find guides for their trips. Guides can either be certified Guides or local people who know about a particular place in detail and wish to earn money through it.  This provides an opportunity for local poor people living in unique places to earn. Here Guides have to initially get registered at the website to get booked for guiding.  For registration, Guide has to provide details such as Fullname, phone number, Address, Identification proof along with a clear photograph which will be required for verification when the guide reaches the guiding group.  To provide security to the tourist group, the guide is verified when reached to the tourist group through face recognition.
